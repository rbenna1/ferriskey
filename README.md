# AuthCrux - Keycloak Light in Go

## Project goals

AuthCrux is a lightweight, modular identity management and authentication system designed to offer a simplified alternative to Keycloak, focusing on the essential features of user authentication, authorization and management.

### Main objectives:

- Provide a lightweight OAuth2/OIDC server written in GB.
- Authentication and user management with PostgreSQL.
- JWT generation and validation.
- Support for essential OAuth2 flows (Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Refresh Token).
- Administration via a REST API and a React web interface.
- Cloud-native deployment on Kubernetes.
